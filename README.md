# Grouping Customers in Banks basing on their Payments and Credit Limits

This data science project uses data to analyze bank customer details. It also creates a clustering model using both Hierarchical (Agglomerative) and Partitional (K-Means) Clustering Methods.

## Objective & Goal
Thus, the objective is to build and train an Unsupervised Clustering Machine Learning model to group customers basing on their payment history and credit limtis.
This project is ideal for data scientists enthusiasts and anyone interested in learning how to train and evaluate models.


## Steps to follow
* Import libraries
* Load dataset
* Data wrangling & exploration - statistical analysis, data cleaning, understanding, visualization, checking outliers etc
* Choosing the model
* Feature engineering & selection
* Handling outliers and standardizing our data (if needed)
* Training model
* Making predictions
* Evaluation of the model
* Improving the model
